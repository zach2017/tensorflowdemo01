Demo Expert System with Tensor Flow


Here's how TensorFlow can be explained using an American Football example:

### TensorFlow as a Football Playbook Designer:

**Imagine TensorFlow is like an innovative playbook designer for your high school football team:**

1. **Tensors as Game Statistics**:
   - **What they are**: In football, you collect stats like yards rushed, passes completed, or points scored. These stats form a "tensor" where each piece of data is like a number on a football field map, showing where the ball has been or players are positioned.

2. **Neural Networks as Play Strategies**:
   - **What they are**: A neural network here could be thought of as a series of football plays. Each layer of the network would translate to different strategic decisions:
     - **First Layer**: Basic offensive and defensive formations.
     - **Middle Layer**: Mid-play adaptations, like when to pass or run.
     - **Final Layer**: Game-deciding moves, like when to go for a touchdown or field goal.

3. **Training with Game Film**:
   - **What it means**: Just like coaches study game films, you feed the neural network (the playbook designer) data from past games. This includes player movements, successful and failed plays, weather conditions, etc.
   - **Example**: If you show the designer plays where short passes worked well against a blitz-happy defense, it would start to "learn" that this strategy could be effective.

4. **Predicting Play Success**:
   - **What it does**: Once trained with enough data, this designer can predict how likely a play is to succeed based on various factors like the opposing team's defense, your team's current performance, or even field conditions.
   - **Example**: Before choosing a play, the designer might predict if a long pass will succeed against the current defensive setup, helping the coach decide between a run or a pass.

### How TensorFlow Works in Football:

- **Building the Model**: You set up your playbook designer (neural network) to analyze football strategies. You decide what kind of data will help in making play calls - this could be player stats, opponent's tendencies, or even field position.

- **Feeding Data**: You give the designer all the game footage, player statistics, and even opponent scouting reports from past games.

- **Learning**: The playbook designer learns from these games by adjusting its recommendations. If a play it suggested didn't work, it tweaks its strategy to learn from that mistake for better future predictions.

- **Using the Model**: During the game, the coach uses this tool to pick plays that have the highest predicted success rate based on the current game situation.

### Simple Football Example:

- **Play Selection**: Suppose your team is on the 20-yard line, trailing by 7 points with 2 minutes left. You've trained your "designer" with data from numerous games, showing how different plays perform under similar conditions. Now, it can suggest whether to attempt a risky long pass or opt for a safer run play to manage the clock and score, based on historical success rates and the opponent's defensive tendencies.

In this way, TensorFlow, like a savvy football strategist, uses complex data analysis to suggest plays that could lead to winning games, much like how a coach would use experience and intuition but with a data-driven approach.
